# Weather App

## This project is made using RapidAPI's [BestWeather API](https://rapidapi.com/standingapi-standingapi-default/api/bestweather).

### To use it please add YOUR OWN api keys in .env file.
#### run command `npm start` which will run a script to write .env file into environment file.
  (approach taken to prevent exposing API keys in repo. For production, store keys in hosting service itself.)  
  
  Keys are:

1. weatherBaseUrl
2. XRapidAPIKey
3. XRapidAPIValue
4. XRapidAPIHostKey
5. XRapidAPIHostValue

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
